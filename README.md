# frequency_transposition
Two Matlab programs allowing a frequency transposition using a complex product and the undersampling property

During an internship at Naval Group (used to be DCNS), I had to program a way to hear ultrasound underwater frequencies. These two programs allowed me to compare the performance of two techniques, a complex product (complex demodulation) and one of the undersampling technique properties.

In the end, the complex product is winning (if you have the right hardware).
A paper will soon follow.
